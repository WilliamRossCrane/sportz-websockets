# ⚡ Sportz – Real-Time Broadcast Engine

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in--progress-yellow)

This project is currently **in progress** and is being built as part of the JavaScript Mastery WebSockets Crash Course.

The goal of this project is to design and implement a **high-frequency real-time broadcast engine** capable of delivering live match scores, commentary, and ball-by-ball updates to **100,000+ concurrent users** with sub-second latency.

This build moves from core WebSocket theory to a production-ready architecture demonstrating how to scale real-time systems without overwhelming the server.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a scalable real-time system that:

- Establishes and manages WebSocket connections
- Ingests match data via REST APIs
- Broadcasts live updates to thousands of connected clients
- Maintains low latency under high concurrency
- Implements production-grade monitoring and security

It simulates a live sports broadcasting platform where data is pushed instantly to connected users.
